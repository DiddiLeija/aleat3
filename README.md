# Aleatoryous 3

This is the 3rth Generation of aleatory objects, built by Diego
Ramirez.

## Introduction

The Aleatoryous package allows you to build:

- Aleatory Syntax objects
  - Dice: aleatory.dice
  - Coin: aleatory.coin
  - Roulette: aleatory.roulette

By using the [Python](http://python.org) library [random](http://docs.python.org/3.8/library/random), Aleatoryous object can build many solutions
for problems where aleatory numbers or specific output are needed.

This package is built to be used with Python versions 3.5 to 3.9.
