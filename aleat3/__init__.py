# A short guide of the Aleatoryous Object:
"""The Diddi's Aleatoryous Project.
===============================================================================================================================
INTRODUCTION

This object was created to give the folowing values:
   1. A 'dice' algorythm.
   2. A 'coin' algorythm.
   3. A 'roulette' algorythm.

In this edition we give a little guide of the posible custom methods of Aleatoryous. We also provided more objects.
===============================================================================================================================
USER GUIDE

To call this Object, type this:

>>>from aleat3 import Aleatoryous

Now, the object creation has two parameters that you should give:

>>>object = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice", None)
                                 ^         ^
1. The 'mode'.
2. The objects (only for the 'roulette' syntax. In other cases, type None).

The method single() gets only one iteration, and can return a Value (String or Integer (In the case of the 'Dice')):

>>>coin = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin", None)
>>>print(coin.single())
Head
>>>print(coin.single())
Head
>>>print(coin.single())
Tails

The method first_5() does the same 5 times and returns a list:

>>>dice = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice", None)
>>>print(dice.first_5())
[6, 3, 5, 6, 1]

The methods first_5_basic() and refresh() are called internally ONLY.
The 'Roulette' syntax is more complex than the others. Look at this:

>>>roul = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", ["Go to sleep",
...                                         "Play videogames",
...                                         "Play the guitar",
...                                         "Make a phone call to Castol",
...                                         "Nothing"])

But the rest is not so different:

>>>print(roul.single())
Make a phone call to Castol
>>>print(dice.first_5())
["Make a phone call to Castol", "Play videogames", "Go to sleep", "Nothing", "Make a phone call to Castol"]

The methods first_10(), first_50() and first_100() are variations of first_5(), so they work as the same:

>>>dice = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice", None)
>>>tot = dice.first_100()
>>>print(tot[45])
4
>>>print(tot[99])
2
>>>print(tot[12:14])
[5, 1]
