## Supported Versions

The table below lists all the versions released to [PyPI](http://pypi.org/project/aleat3).

The versions that will still receive active support (on issues, discussions, and PRs) are labeled with :white_check_mark:.

Most of the versions are no longer supported (labeled with :x:). Some of them are programmed to be deprecated (or yanked by PyPI), this means they will receive support
by the moment but not in the future (labeled with a :warning:).

The `Development Status` label lets you know the status of the release (these are: `Latest`, `Stable`, `To be deprecated`, `Unsupported`, `Yanked (on PyPI)` and `Deleted`).
